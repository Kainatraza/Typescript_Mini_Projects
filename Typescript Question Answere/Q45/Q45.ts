//Q45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

interface Car {
    manufacturer: string;
    modelName: string;

    [key: string]: string | number | boolean; 
}

function storeCarInfo(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...options: Car[]): Car {
    let car:Car = {
        manufacturer,
        modelName,

    };

  
    for (let option of options) {
        Object.assign(car, option);
    }

    return car;
}


let carInfo = storeCarInfo('Toyota', 'Camry', {color: 'Blue'; hasSunroof: true;});


console.log(carInfo);
