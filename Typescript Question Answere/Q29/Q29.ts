//  Q29 Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

let favorite_fruits = ["banana", "apple", "mango"];

if (favorite_fruits.includes("banana")) {
    console.log("You really like bananas!");
}

if (favorite_fruits.includes("apple")) {
    console.log("You really like apples!");
}

if (favorite_fruits.includes("mango")) {
    console.log("You really like mangoes!");
}

if (favorite_fruits.includes("strawberry")) {
    console.log("You really like strawberries!");
} else {
    console.log("Strawberries are not in your list of favorite fruits.");
}

if (favorite_fruits.includes("kiwi")) {
    console.log("You really like kiwis!");
